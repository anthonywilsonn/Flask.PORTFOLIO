Self Grade:
WEEK 1: Anthony Wilson: 10/10, I participated in all of the discussions this week while also talking a lot with Mr. Mortensen about a new HTML project to work on with a website. Additionally, I worked in my personal playground with the HTML templates that the teacher made and also made a project outline with Ryan Shay on our news website idea.

Week 1: Ryan Shay: 10/10, I played to the lectures and practiced routing and understanding the code in my playground. I also begun working on the front end design for the website and how the aesthetic should look. I settled on a nice color pallete. I started watching tutorial videos on flask and html so that I can better understand and code the backend

WEEK 2: Anthony Wilson:10/10, I participated really well this week and worked a lot on the website and the code. Additionally, we successfully imported a navbar template that works while also including the different headers for the navbar. It was a successuful week, we learned some more about html and also added a navbar.

Week 2: Ryan Shay: 10/10, I finished up the front end skecthes and design for the website. I then found a sutible html template to match our design and work for us. I was able to incoroporate the navbar template into the code to make it appear and change the header titles. I continued watching tutorial videos on flask and html. I now understand the sysnthesis between the two things a lot better.



HOW TO RUN:
On the repl.it, it takes a while to run and is quite inconsistent, so for the best running experience we recommend opening the website in a new tab which can be accessed by pressing the 'open in a new tab' button which is on the right of the link.
